# ShorterEarl
Shorter Earl (Shorter URL) is a URL shortener built with React and Next.js.

Shorter Earl uses Firebase Firestore as a database to save randomly generated URLs,
Once given a link, Shorter Earl will generate a shortened link for use.

## Notes
This project uses an API route to save links and therefor the Admin SDK for firebase, the key for which is not safe to expose.
Therefor, this project cannot run on any computer and is mostly an educational project on how a link shortener might look.
